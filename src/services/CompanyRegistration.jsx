              Why is Company Registration Important?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Registering your company is not just about paperwork; it is about giving your business
              a <strong>legal identity</strong>. A registered company builds trust with customers,
              suppliers, banks, and investors. It also offers protection from personal liability,
              ensures compliance with government rules, and opens the door to various benefits such
              as funding opportunities, tax advantages, and business credibility.
